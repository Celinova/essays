# Fucking Writing

Writing is hard. It's the stiff dildo in your ass, but you have to be careful to take it out, or you will be bleeding out of your colon. Especially if it's your first time. It *really* hurts. But with a lot of practice stretching your asshole, one can get could at shoving things up their ass.

You first decide what you're going to shove in there. I like to think of people's special interests as their own kinks. Depending on what you like, determines the nature of the beast.
