# Little things I've noticed...


There are some things that I've noticed that have been bugging me these past couple of weeks. It's just one of those things where you are unsure whether the way you look at it is something unhealthy, like those hate-obsessed people who let something live rent-free in their heads. They just can't stop thinking, or even talking about something that hardly has any effect on them and are making a big deal out of something so small.

That thing I noticed, it's just that I don't feel the most welcome. There are some things that I don't know to take seriously. And it's hypocritical. And maybe it is an admission on my part, a confession that I'm trying to get out to better understand what I'm feeling. And that it is.

You know what I think? It's actually getting people to understand the thoughts in your mind. 

Pretty often, you'll find these thoughts that need to be explained to someone in order to destroy some underlying assumption that people have. And this is in everyone. People assume some things because there is some bias or emotional state they've experienced in the past that is getting in the way of rational thought. Now we're all human, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't make it right, that we shouldn't try to examine these things.

And it's frustrating. It really is. Just to try to explain things. Here I am thinking I am making myself look really stupid. These people don't know what I'm talking about at all. 

So, where to start with all of this? It's quite clear that people don't really think systematically, nor do they take very seriously a gratuitously long explanation. So, when I explain something, _we have to start somewhere to give enough grounding that people already know, and then say something people don't know_.

For example, people know that I am going to do x. But some won't see the "point". People need a reason. So, for starters, we can simply say that "I am doing x because of y". No need for a complicated explanation. 

Now, there are certain events where this isn't sufficient, and you have to go out of your way to actually justify yourself. In that case, we'd have to make it so that it is universally applicable such that in any such case where the universal can be applied, people don't bring up these ridiculous specific examples, and the only specific examples that we'll be looking at are the exception to the rules. All-encompassing statements like all, none, some. Those things will come in handy.

The real tricky part is thinking about this "statistically".
