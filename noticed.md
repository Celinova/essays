# Little things I've noticed...


There are some things that I've noticed that have been bugging me these past couple of weeks. It's just one of those things where you are unsure whether the way you look at it is something unhealthy, like those hate-obsessed people who let something live rent-free in their heads. They just can't stop thinking, or even talking about something that hardly has any effect on them and are making a big deal out of something so small.

That thing I noticed, it's just that I don't feel the most welcome. There are some things that I don't know to take seriously. And it's hypocritical. And maybe it is an admission on my part, a confession that I'm trying to get out to better understand what I'm feeling. And that it is.

You know what I think? It's actually getting people to understand the thoughts in your mind. 

Pretty often, you'll find these thoughts that need to be explained to someone in order to destroy some underlying assumption that people have. And this is in everyone. People assume some things because there is some bias or emotional state they've experienced in the past that is getting in the way of rational thought. Now we're all human, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't make it right, that we shouldn't try to examine these things.
